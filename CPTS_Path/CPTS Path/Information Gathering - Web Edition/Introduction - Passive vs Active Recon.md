 - This process involves systematically and meticulously collecting information about a target website or web application.

The primary goals of web reconnaissance include:

- `Identifying Assets`: Uncovering all **publicly accessible components** of the target, such a**s web pages, subdomains, IP addresses,** and technologies used. This step provides a comprehensive overview of the target's online presence.
- `Discovering Hidden Information`: Locating **sensitive information** that might be inadvertently exposed, including **backup files, configuration files, or internal documentation**. These findings can reveal valuable insights and potential entry points for attacks.
- `Analysing the Attack Surface`: Examining the **target's attack surface to identify potential vulnerabilities and weaknesses.** This involves assessing the technologies used, configurations, and possible entry points for exploitation.
- `Gathering Intelligence`: Collecting information that can be leveraged **for further exploitation or social engineering attack**s. This includes identifying key personnel, email addresses, or patterns of behaviour that could be exploited.
