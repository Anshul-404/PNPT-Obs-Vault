- To fuzz the `data` field with `ffuf`, **we can use the `-d` flag, as we saw previously in the output of `ffuf -h`**. 
- We also **have to add `-X POST` to send `POST` requests.**
- Tip: In PHP, "POST" data "content-type" can only accept "application/x-www-form-urlencoded". So, we can set that in "ffuf" with "-H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded'".
- So, let us repeat what we did earlier, but place our `FUZZ` keyword after the `-d` flag:
	- `ffuf -w /opt/useful/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/burp-parameter-names.txt:FUZZ -u http://admin.academy.htb:PORT/admin/admin.php -X POST -d 'FUZZ=key' -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' -fs xxx`
