# Understanding of What We Have to Look for
---
- **==Every target is unique==**, and we need to familiarize ourselves with our target, **its processes, procedures, business model, and purpose.** 
- Once we understand our target, **==we can think about what information is essential for them and what kind of information is helpful for our attack.==**
- There are two key elements to finding sensitive information:
	1. We need to understand the service and how it works.
	2. We need to know what we are looking for.
