# Lateral Movement
---
- Lateral movement can be described as a technique used to further our **access to additional `hosts`, `applications`, and `services` within a network environment.**
- Lateral Movement often enables privilege escalation across hosts. 

# Pivoting
---
- Utilizing **multiple hosts to cross `network` boundaries** you would not usually have access to is known as Pivoting.
- This is more of a targeted objective.

# Tunneling
---
- The key here is **obfuscation of our actions to avoid detection** for as long as possible.
- We **utilize protocols with enhanced security** measures such as HTTPS over TLS or SSH over other transport protocols.
- These types of actions also enable tactics like the exfiltration of data out of a target network or the delivery of more payloads and instructions into the network.
