- [SQLMap](https://github.com/sqlmapproject/sqlmap) is a free and open-source penetration testing tool written in Python that automates the process of detecting and exploiting SQL injection (SQLi) flaws.
- `python sqlmap.py -u 'http://inlanefreight.htb/page.php?id=5'
- `sqlmap -hh`

## Basic Scenario
---
- In a simple scenario, a penetration tester a**ccesses the web page that accepts user input via a `GET` parameter** (e.g., `id`).
- They then want to test **if the web page is affected by the SQL injection vulnerability**.
- An example SQLi vulnerable PHP code for this scenario would look as follows:
	- ![[Pasted image 20251026053737.png]]
- To run SQLMap against this example, located at the example URL `http://www.example.com/vuln.php?id=1`, would look like the following:
	- `sqlmap -u "http://www.example.com/vuln.php?id=1" --batch`

- **Note**: in this case, **option '-u' is used to provide the target URL**, while the switch **'--batch' is used for skipping any required user-input**, by **automatically choosing using the default option.**

## SQLMap Output Description
---
- ## URL content is stable
	- "target URL content is stable": This means that there **are no major changes between responses in case of continuous** **identical requests.**
	- This is important from the automation point of view since, **in the event of stable responses, it is easier to spot differences** caused by the potential SQLi attempts.
- **Parameter appears to be dynamic**
	- "GET parameter 'id' appears to be dynamic"
	- It is always desired for the tested parameter to be "dynamic," as it is a **sign that any changes made to its value would result in a change in the response**; hence the parameter **may be linked to a database**.
- **Parameter might be injectable**
	- "heuristic (basic) test shows that GET parameter 'id' might be injectable (possible DBMS: 'MySQL')"
	- In this case, there was a **MySQL error when SQLMap** sends an **intentionally invalid value was used (e.g. `?id=1",)..).))'`), which indicates that the tested parameter could be SQLi injectable** and that the target could be MySQL.
- **Parameter might be vulnerable to XSS attacks**
	- "heuristic (XSS) test shows that GET parameter 'id' might be vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks"
	- While it is not its primary purpose, SQLMap also **runs a quick heuristic test for the presence of an XSS vulnerability.**
	- In large-scale tests, where a lot of parameters are being tested with SQLMap, it is nice to have these kinds of fast heuristic checks, especially if there are no SQLi vulnerabilities found.
- **Back-end DBMS is '...'**
	- "it looks like the back-end DBMS is 'MySQL'. Do you want to skip test payloads specific for other DBMSes? [Y/n]"
	- In case that there is a **clear indication that the target is using the specific DBMS**, **we can narrow down the payloads to just that specific DBMS.**
- **Level/risk values**
	- "for the remaining tests, do you want to include all tests for 'MySQL' extending provided level (1) and risk (1) values? [Y/n]"
	- If there is a clear indication that the target uses the specific DBMS, it is also possible to **extend the tests for that same specific DBMS beyond the regular tests.**
	- This basically **means running all SQL injection payloads for that specific DBMS, while if no DBMS were detected, only top payloads would be tested**.
- **Reflective values found**
	- "reflective value(s) found and filtering out"
	- Just a warning that parts of the used payloads are found in the response.
	- This behavior could cause problems to automation tools, as it represents the junk. However, SQLMap has filtering mechanisms to remove such junk before comparing the original page content.
- **Parameter appears to be injectable**
	-  "GET parameter 'id' appears to be 'AND boolean-based blind - WHERE or HAVING clause' injectable (with --string="luther")"
	- This message indicates that the **parameter appears to be injectable**, **though there is still a chance for it to be a false-positive finding.**
	- In the case of **boolean-based blind and similar SQLi types (e.g., time-based blind),** where there is a **high chance of false-positives**, at the end of the run, SQLMap performs **extensive testing** consisting of simple logic checks for **removal of false-positive findings.**
- **Time-based comparison statistical model**
	- "time-based comparison requires a larger statistical model, please wait........... (done)"
	- SQLMap uses a **statistical model for the recognition of regular and (deliberately) delayed target responses.** 
	- For this model to work, there is a requirement to collect a **sufficient number of regular response times**. This way, SQLMap **can statistically distinguish between the deliberate delay even in the high-latency** network environments.
- **Extending UNION query injection technique tests**
	- "automatically extending ranges for UNION query injection technique tests as there is at least one other (potential) technique found"
	- **UNION-query SQLi** checks **require considerably more requests** for successful recognition of usable payload than other SQLi types.
	- To **lower the testing time per parameter**, especially if the target does not appear to be injectable, **the number of requests is capped to a constant value (i.e., 10)** for this type of check.
	- However, **if there is a good chance that the target is vulnerable, especially as one other (potential) SQLi technique is found**, SQLMap **extends the default number of requests** for UNION query SQLi, because of a higher expectancy of success.
- **Technique appears to be usable**
	- "ORDER BY' technique appears to be usable. This should reduce the time needed to find the right number of query columns. Automatically extending the range for current UNION query injection technique test"
	- As a heuristic check **for the UNION-query SQLi type, before the actual `UNION` payloads are sent, a technique known as `ORDER BY` is checked** for usability. 
	- In case that it is usable, **SQLMap can quickly recognize the correct number of required `UNION` column**s by conducting the binary-search approach.
- **Parameter is vulnerable**
	- "GET parameter 'id' is vulnerable. Do you want to keep testing the others (if any)? [y/N]"
	- This is one of the **most important messages of SQLMap,** as it means that the **parameter was found to be vulnerable to SQL injections**.
	- In the regular cases, the user may only want to find at least one injection point (i.e., parameter) usable against the target.
	- However, if **we were running an extensive test on the web application** and want to **report all potential vulnerabilities**, we can **continue searching for all vulnerable parameters.**
- **Sqlmap identified injection points**
	- "sqlmap identified the following injection point(s) with a total of 46 HTTP(s) requests:"
	- Following after is a **listing of all injection points with type, title, and payloads**, which represents the final proof of successful detection and exploitation of found SQLi vulnerabilities. 
	- It should be noted that SQLMap **lists only those findings which are provably exploitable** (i.e., usable).
