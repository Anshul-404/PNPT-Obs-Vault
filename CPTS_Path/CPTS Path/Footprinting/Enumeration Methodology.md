Entrance layers: These layers are designed as follows:

| **Layer**                | **Description**                                                                                        | **Information Categories**                                                                         |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `1. Internet Presence`   | Identification of internet presence and externally accessible infrastructure.                          | Domains, Subdomains, vHosts, ASN, Netblocks, IP Addresses, Cloud Instances, Security Measures      |
| `2. Gateway`             | Identify the possible security measures to protect the company's external and internal infrastructure. | Firewalls, DMZ, IPS/IDS, EDR, Proxies, NAC, Network Segmentation, VPN, Cloudflare                  |
| `3. Accessible Services` | Identify accessible interfaces and services that are hosted externally or internally.                  | Service Type, Functionality, Configuration, Port, Version, Interface                               |
| `4. Processes`           | Identify the internal processes, sources, and destinations associated with the services.               | PID, Processed Data, Tasks, Source, Destination                                                    |
| `5. Privileges`          | Identification of the internal permissions and privileges to the accessible services.                  | Groups, Users, Permissions, Restrictions, Environment                                              |
| `6. OS Setup`            | Identification of the internal components and systems setup.                                           | OS Type, Patch Level, Network config, OS Environment, Configuration files, sensitive private files |
1. The goal of this layer is to identify all possible target systems and interfaces that can be tested. 
2. The goal is to understand what we are dealing with and what we have to watch out for.
3. This layer aims to understand the reason and functionality of the target system and gain the necessary knowledge to communicate with it and exploit it for our purposes effectively.
4. Every time a command or function is executed, data is processed, whether entered by the user or generated by the system. This starts a process that has to perform specific tasks, and such tasks have at least one source and one target.
5. Each service runs through a specific user in a particular group with permissions and privileges defined by the administrator or the system. These privileges often provide us with functions that administrators overlook. This often happens in Active Directory infrastructures and many other case-specific administration environments and servers where users are responsible for multiple administration areas.
6. Here we collect information about the actual operating system and its setup using internal access. This gives us a good overview of the internal security of the systems and reflects the skills and capabilities of the company's administrative teams.
