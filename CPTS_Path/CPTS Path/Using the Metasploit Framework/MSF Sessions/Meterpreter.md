- The `Meterpreter` Payload is a specific type of multi-faceted, extensible Payload that uses `DLL injection` to ensure the connection to the victim host is stable and difficult to detect using simple checks and can be configured to be persistent across reboots or system changes.
- Furthermore, Meterpreter resides entirely in the memory of the remote host and leaves no traces on the hard drive, making it difficult to detect with conventional forensic techniques.

# Note:- A lot is already known by me and covered in PNPT, please check priv esc using meterpreter
