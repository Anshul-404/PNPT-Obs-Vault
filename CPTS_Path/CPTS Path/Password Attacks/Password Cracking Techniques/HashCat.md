- [Hashcat](https://hashcat.net/) is a **well-known password cracking tool for Linux, Windows, and macOS**. From 2009 until 2015 it was proprietary software, but has since been released as open-source.
- Featuring **fantastic GPU support,** it can be used to crack a large variety of hashes.

# Hash types
---
- Hashcat **supports hundreds of different hash types**, each of which is assigned a ID. 
- A list of **associated IDs can be generated by running hashcat --help**.

# Attack modes
---
- Hashcat has many different attack mode, including **dictionary, mask, combinator, and association.**

## Dictionary attack
- Dictionary attack (`-a 0`) is, as the name suggests, **a dictionary attack.** 
- The user provides **password hashes and a wordlist as input, and Hashcat tests each word in the list as a potential password** until the correct one is found or the list is exhausted:
	- `hashcat -a 0 -m 0 e3e3ec5831ad5e7288241960e5d4fdb8 /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt`

## ==Using Rules==
-  The **rule files that come with hashcat are typically found under `/usr/share/hashcat/rules`**
- One ruleset we could try is `best64.rule`, which contains 64 standard password modificationsâ€”**such as appending numbers or ==substituting characters with their "leet" equivalents**:==
	- `hashcat -a 0 -m 0 1b0556a75770563578569ae21392630c /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -r /usr/share/hashcat/rules/best64.rule`

## ==Mask attack==
- Mask attack (-a 3) is a type of brute-force attack in **which the keyspace is explicitly defined by the user.** 
- For example, if we know that a password is eight characters long, rather than attempting every possible combination, **we might define a mask that tests combinations of six letters followed by two numbers.**
- Let's say that we specifically want to try passwords **which start with an uppercase letter, continue with four lowercase letters, a digit, and then a symbol.** 
	- The resulting hashcat mask would be `?u?l?l?l?l?d?s`.
	- `hashcat -a 3 -m 0 1e293d6912d074c0fd15844d803400dd '?u?l?l?l?l?d?s'`
