`Confidentiality`, `integrity`, and `availability` are at the core of every infosec practitioner's responsibilities. Without maintaining a balance among them, we cannot ensure the security of our enterprises.


## Authentication
---
Authentication, at its core, is the validation of your identity by presenting a **combination of four factors to a validation mechanism.** They are:

1. `Something you know`: a password, passcode, pin, etc.
2. `Something you have`: an ID Card, security key, or other MFA tools
3. `Something you are`: your physical self, username, email address, or other identifiers
4. `Somewhere you are`: geolocation, IP address, etc.
