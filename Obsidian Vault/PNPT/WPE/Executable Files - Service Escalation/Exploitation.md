- We can also check in `cmd`using `accesschk64.exe:
	- `C:\Users\User\Desktop\Tools\Accesschk\accesschk64.exe -wvu "C:\Program Files\File Permissions Service"`=> Agree

# Exploitation

- **Transfer malicious `x.exe`file**  (**which adds our user to administrators group**) generated from C [[PNPT/WPE/regsvc ACL/Exploitation|Exploitation]]
- **Rename to `filepermservice.exe`and override** `C:\Program Files...\filepermservice.exe`binary
	- ![[Pasted image 20250417161718.png]]
- **Start the service:**
	- `sc start filepermsvc`
