- If we have a service whose **service binary's path is not enclosed within quotes AND contains a space** 
- **==This binary is runs as system when the service starts==**

- Windows will go through each of the strings in the path separated with space and try to find the executable. For example :-
	- `C:\Program.exe`
	- `C:\Program Files\Unquoted.exe`
	- `C:\Program Files\Unquoted Path.exe`
	- `C:\Program Files\Unquoted Path Service\Common.exe`
	- `.....`And so on
