Holo is an Active Directory and Web Application attack lab that teaches core web attack vectors and advanced\obscure Active Directory attacks along with general red teaming methodology and concepts.

Before we get too overzealous in attacking web servers and hacking the world, we need to identify our scope and perform some initial recon to identify assets. 
Your trusted agent has informed you that the scope of the engagement is **10.200.x.0/24 and 192.168.100.0/24**. To begin the assessment, you can scan the ranges provided and identify any public-facing infrastructure to obtain a foothold.
