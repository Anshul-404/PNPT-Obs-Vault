- Try the following :
	- Renaming file from `file.png` to `file.php` after pressing upload in `burpsuite`
	- Renaming file from `file.php` to `file.png.php` and then uploading
	- Renaming file from `file.php` to `file.php%00.png` after/before pressing upload in `burpsuite`
	- Renaming file from `file.php` to `file.php.png` after/before pressing upload (might work in cases of `regex` search)
	- Changing a number of letters to their capital forms to bypass case sensitive rules (e.g. `“file.aSp” or “file.PHp3”`).
	- Trying different `php` extensions like `asd`, `phtml`, `php2`, `php3`, etc.
	- `Content-Type` in burpsuite
	- Try `Magic Bytes`
