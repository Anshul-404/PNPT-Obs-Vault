- **Credential Stuffing**
	- Credential stuffing is a cyber attack in which credentials obtained from a [data breach](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/what-is-a-data-breach/) on one service are used to attempt to log in to another unrelated service.
- **Password Spraying**
	- The basics of a password spraying attack involve a [threat actor](https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/cybersecurity-101/threat-intelligence/threat-actor/) using a single common password against multiple accounts on the same application. This avoids the account lockouts.
